# The State of Colorado Congressional Electiion Analysis.
## 1. Overview
#### Seth and Tom needs help in auditing the recently held election in State of Colorado. They have dataset for all the ballots casted and now want simple coding to determine total number of votes casted, complete list of candidates, votes each candidate received, percentage of votes received by each candidates, counties voter turnouts, largest counties by vote and the winner of the election. These auditing could be easily done by the use of tool such as Excel, however, Seth and his team wanted to create a program that can be used for any and all type of election in future. The objective of this module was to create a code in python which audits the election results and can be used in future as well. 
## 2. Election-Audit Results
- The total number of votes casted in the congressional election was 369,711.   
- Breakdown of the votes and vote percentage for each county. 
    
    - Jefferson County: 10.5% (38,855)
    - Denver County: 82.8% (306,055)
    - Arapahoe County: 3.1% (24,801)
    
- The county with the largest number of vote is Denver County. 
- Breakdown of votes and vote percentage for each Candidate.

    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
 - Diana DeGette won the election with total votes of 272,892 and won by 73.8% compared to other candidates.  

## 3. Election-Audit Summary 

#### This python script written for congressional election analysis can be used by anyone and at any level of elections. The minor modifications can be made to use this election analysis script. Lets take and example of presedential election, presedential election will have extra data columns such as state, city, precinct along with county. For complete Presedential election audit, we can initialize appropriate variables for states, city and precinct, and add if statements to check, append and calculatetotal votes, vote turnouts winner, popular votes for states, city and precinct.  

The script for current election analysis is available below.
